## MeTL
MeTL is our group project for a Software Engineering class. We were tasked to come up with an enhancment to make MeTL better. Our group came up with a search function so both the student and the instructor can parse through the immense amount of data that is being collected through MeTL. The enhancment specifications include: Develop a tool for the user interacting with Whiteboard to be able to search the content, Further refine the search function within whiteboard as well as made the zoom function move on the canvas, and Add an additional box to let the user know if the search string matched within the canvas or not.
